# FTIR Data
This branch contains ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) data examining polymer surface oxidation following incubation with microbial isolates from the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

The dataset includes both monoculture and monoculture/coculture experiments. Separate branches are used to organize these datasets for clarity and version tracking.

The Monocultures folder contains FTIR data from experiments where individual isolates were incubated with polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films.

The Monoculture & Coculture folder contains FTIR data from experiments where two isolates were co-incubated with the same plastic film to assess microbial interactions and inhibitory or synergistic effects.

The accompanying .prism files include all statistical analyses and graphical visualizations of the data used in this study.
