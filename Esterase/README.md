# Esterase Activity

This dataset contains raw data from esterase activity assays performed on bacterial isolates derived from the guts of wild threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The assays were conducted on tributyrin agar plates (1% and 2%) to quantify lipolytic/esterase activity by measuring zone of clearance (mmÂ²).

These experiments were designed to assess hydrolytic enzyme production under different substrate concentrations and to compare activity between isolates grown in monoculture and in coculture combinations to evaluate potential microbial interactions influencing esterase activity.

The accompanying .prism files include all statistical analyses and graphical visualizations of the data used in this study.
