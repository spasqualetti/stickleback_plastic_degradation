# stickleback_plastic_degradation
This repository contains the complete experimental datasets from the study “Cold-water stickleback gut isolates reveal polypropylene surface oxidation and coculture inhibition.”
Bacterial isolates were obtained from the guts of wild threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) collected across multiple bodies of water in Southcentral Alaska. Each isolate was characterized for its potential role in plastic degradation through assays of enzymatic activity, biofilm formation, and plastic surface modification.

The repository is organized into five folders, each corresponding to a major experimental dataset: Lipase, Esterase, Biofilm, FTIR, and XPS.

Stickleback strain identifications have been deposited in GenBank under Accession Numbers PX470357 and PX519477 - PX519659.
