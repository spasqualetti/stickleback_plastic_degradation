# Biofilm Formation

This dataset contains raw and processed data from biofilm formation assays performed on microbial isolates derived from the guts of wild threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Biofilm formation was quantified by measuring optical density (OD₅₉₀) following crystal violet staining. These data support analyses of inter-isolate variation and normalization of biofilm activity relative to controls.

Biofilm_RawOD_InitialScreen.xlsx - Raw OD₅₉₀ measurements from the initial high-throughput screen of all isolates. Each isolate was tested in triplicate to assess whether biofilms formed on plastics. Dates on sheets denote when experiments were performed.

RawOD_Biofilm_Reported.xlsx - Cleaned and averaged raw absorbance data for each biological replicate. Values represent unnormalized OD₅₉₀ readings used for statistical analyses. Dates on sheets denote when experiments were performed.

Relative_Biofilm_Formation_Normalized_Reported.csv - Normalized biofilm formation values expressed relative to surface area (mean isolate OD₅₉₀ ÷ mean control OD₅₉₀). This file represents the data used for figure generation and statistical tests.

Relative_Biofilm_Formation_Normalized_Monocultures_Cocultures.csv - Normalized biofilm formation values expressed relative to surface area (mean isolate OD₅₉₀ ÷ mean control OD₅₉₀). This files compares biofilm formation between monocultures and cocultures.

The accompanying .prism files include all statistical analyses and graphical visualizations of the data used in this study.
