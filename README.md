# Lipase Activity

This dataset contains raw and processed data from lipase activity assays performed on bacterial isolates derived from the guts of wild threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). 

These experiments were designed to evaluate lipase production across bacterial isolates and to examine how microbial interactions influence lipase activity. Both monoculture and coculture assays were included to identify potential enhancement or inhibition of lipase activity resulting from interspecies interactions.
